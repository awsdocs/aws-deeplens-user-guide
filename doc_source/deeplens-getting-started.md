# Getting Started with AWS DeepLens<a name="deeplens-getting-started"></a>



In the following procedures, we walk you through securely connecting your AWS DeepLens and deploying your first models\. Get started with an easy project that enables you to use your AWS DeepLens device to identify ordinary objects in 10 mins\. When you're ready, try our more challenging cat identification tutorial, a template of the work flow for creating your own custom projects\.



**Note**  
To use the AWS DeepLens console and other AWS services, you need an AWS account\. If you don't have an account, visit aws\.amazon\.com and choose **Create an AWS Account**\. For detailed instructions, see Create and Activate an AWS Account\.

After you've created your AWS account, sign in to the AWS DeepLens console, with your AWS account or user credentials\. The topics in this section assume you've signed in to the AWS DeepLens console\.
