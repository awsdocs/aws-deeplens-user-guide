Device registration takes a few minutes to process\. When the registration completes successfully, **Registration status** changes to **Registered**\. If the process fails, **Registration status** becomes **Failed**\. In this case, choose **Deregister** and then start the registration all over again\. When the registration is interrupted or otherwise incomplete, **Registration status** remains **Awaiting credentials**\. In this case, [reconnect to the device's `AMDC-NNNN` Wi\-Fi network](deeplens-getting-started-connect.md) to resume the registration\.

When the device's **Registration status** and **Device status** becomes **Registered** and **Online**, respectively, you're ready to create and deploy a project to your AWS DeepLens device\.
