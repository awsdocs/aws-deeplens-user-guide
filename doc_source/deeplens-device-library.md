# AWS DeepLens Device Library<a name="deeplens-device-library"></a>

 The AWS DeepLens device library consists of a set of Python modules that provide objects and methods for various device operations: 
+ The `awscam` module for running inference code based on a project's model\.
+  The `mo` module for converting your Caffe, Apache MXNet or TensorFlow deep learning model artifacts into AWS DeepLens model artifacts and performing necessary optimization\. 
+ The `DeepLens_Kinesis_Video` module for integrating with Kinesis Video Streams to manage streaming from the AWS DeepLens device to a Kinesis Video Streams stream\.
