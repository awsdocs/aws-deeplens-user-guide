# Create and Deploy an AWS DeepLens Project<a name="deeplens-create-deploy-project"></a>

An AWS DeepLens project consists of a deep learning model and a Lambda function that makes inferences of an input image based on the deep learning model\. 

For the testing purpose, you can deploy to your registered device a sample project with a pre\-trained deep learning model and a tested inference Lambda function created by AWS DeepLens\. For more information, see [Building AWS DeepLens Projects](deeplens-projects.md)\.

To use a sample project, follow the instructions given in [Create and Deploy an AWS DeepLens Sample Project in the AWS DeepLens Console](deeplens-create-deploy-sample-project.md)\.
