# Working with AWS DeepLens Sample Projects<a name="deeplens-sample-projects"></a>

When your AWS DeepLens device is registered and connected to the AWS Cloud, you're ready  to create an AWS DeepLens project and deploy it to the device to run computer vision application on\. An AWS DeepLens project  is made up of an AWS DeepLens model and the associated AWS Lambda function to run inference with\. You can use a pre\-trained model in your project or you can train a custom model\.

AWS DeepLens provides several sample projects for you to deploy and run inference on right out of the box\. Here, you'll learn how to use a sample project and deploy it to your AWS DeepLens device\. Before we start, let's get an overview of the sample projects\.
