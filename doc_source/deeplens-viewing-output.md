# Viewing AWS DeepLens Output Streams<a name="deeplens-viewing-output"></a>

An AWS DeepLens device produces two output streams: the device stream and a project stream\. The *device stream* is an unprocessed video stream\. The *project stream* is the result of the processing that the model performs on the video frames\. 

 You can view the output in a supported web browser when your AWS DeepLens device is online\. For more information, see [View Video Streams from AWS DeepLens Device in Browser](deeplens-viewing-device-output-in-browser.md)\. In addition, you can also view the output on the device that is connected to a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse\. The instructions are given in this section\.
