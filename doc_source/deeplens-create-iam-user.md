# Create an IAM User<a name="deeplens-create-iam-user"></a>

The following procedure walks you through the steps to create an [AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html), which is preferred to using the root user of your AWS account, to use AWS DeepLens for your deep learning computer vision applications\. 

**To create an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**, then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **Access type**, choose both **Programmatic Access** to call APIs of permitted AWS services and **AWS Management Console Access** to launch the AWS Management Console for permitted services\.

1. For **Console password**, choose **Autogenerated password** or **Custom password**\. If you choose **Custom password**, type a password\.

1. Choose whether to require the user to reset the password at the next sign\-in, then choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. For **Set permissions for *<user name>***, choose **Attach existing policies directly**, select the check box next to a listed policy, e\.g\., **AdministratorAccess** if you want the user to have the administrator's privileges, and then choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Review the settings\. To return to the previous page to make changes, choose **Previous**\. To create the user, choose **Create user**\.

Now that you have an AWS account and IAM user, continue to [Register Your AWS DeepLens Device](deeplens-getting-started-register.md)\.
