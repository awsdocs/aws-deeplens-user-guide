# Deleting AWS DeepLens Resources<a name="deeplens-delete-resources"></a>

When you build your computer vision application and deploy it to your AWS DeepLens device, you store AWS DeepLens resources—such as a device profile, a deployed project, and a model—in the AWS Cloud\. When you are done with your AWS DeepLens project, you can use the AWS console to delete the model, project, and AWS DeepLens logs from CloudWatch Logs\. To delete a registered device profile, see [Deregistering Your AWS DeepLens Device](deeplens-deregister-device.md)\.
