## The AWS DeepLens Device<a name="deeplens-versions-v1"></a>

First introduced at AWS re:Invent 2017, the AWS DeepLens device became available in the US market on June 14, 2018 with the support of a limited set of pre\-trained models for 
+ [Artistic style transfer](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#artistic-style-transfer)
+ [Object recognition](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#object-recognition)
+ [Face detection and recognition](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#face-detection-recognition)
+ [Hot dog recognition](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#hot-dog-not-hot-dog)
+ [Cat and dog recognition](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#cat-or-dog)
+ [Action recognition](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#action-recognition)

Later, more pre\-trained models were added to the support:
+ [Head pose detection](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#head-pose-detection)
+ [Bird classification](deeplens-templated-projects-overview.md#bird-classification)
